"""
Payment module for DriveShieldX.

IMPORTANT — HONEST SCOPE:
This module builds a REAL UPI payment request (the `upi://pay?...` deep link that
Google Pay / PhonePe / Paytm actually understand) and renders it as a scannable QR.
If you configure a genuine payee UPI ID (PAYEE_VPA below) and scan the QR with a real
UPI app, the app WILL open a real payment screen to that ID.

What it does NOT do (and legally cannot, without a registered business + payment-gateway
merchant account + server-side secret keys): automatically confirm that money was received.
Confirming receipt requires a payment gateway webhook (Razorpay/Paytm/PhonePe), which needs
KYC and a company. So this module models the settlement step as a verifiable transaction
record (PENDING -> SUCCESS) with a transaction id and receipt, the same shape a real gateway
callback would give you. Swapping in a real gateway later means replacing `mark_paid()` with
the gateway's verify call — everything else stays the same.
